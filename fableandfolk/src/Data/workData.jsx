      "Crafting a quirky e-commerce experience that sparkles with personality.",
    fable: "Maya & Mi had a beloved local store filled with unique, handcrafted gifts, but their online presence felt generic and disconnected. Their digital storefront didn't reflect the vibrant personality of their physical space. The challenge was to capture that quirky, joyful spirit and translate it into an online store that was just as delightful to browse.",
    folk: "We partnered directly with Maya, the founder, a passionate curator of gifts with heart. We knew we weren't just building a site for her, but for the thoughtful friends and family across India looking for a present that felt personal and special. Understanding this 'folk' was key to our process",
